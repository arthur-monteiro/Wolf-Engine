# Wolf-Engine

Yet another Vulkan engine.

This engine helps you to develop Vulkan project with:
- Basic Vulkan element handling: Image, Sampler, Buffer, Uniform Buffer, Command Buffer, Descriptor Set, Pipeline...
- VR with OVR (for Oculus devices)
- Ray tracing with management of bottom level and top level acceleration structures
- Object loading
- Image from file loading
- Some rendering algorithms: GBuffer creation, cascaded shadow mapping, blur, PBR direct lighting, SSAO
- Text rendering

You can find [some basic examples here](https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/Wolf-Engine-Examples).

Deprecated, now developping Wolf Engine 2.0 (https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/WolfEngine-2.0)
